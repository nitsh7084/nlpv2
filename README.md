A search page enabled with natural language processing
[DEMO](http://www.amituslab.com/NLP/nlp1.html)

##How is this different

The search page allows the user to search for particular items based on a statement, which provides a great alternative and makes it very easy to express what he/she is looking for.

##How to use

An nlp powered form can be created by instantiating NLForm with the form element.

```javascript
new NLForm(form_element)
```
